# Detecting Stock Market Crashes with Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

As long as there will be financial markets, there will be financial crashes. Most suffer when the market takes a dipâ€¦ those who can foresee it can protect their assets or take risky short positions to make a profit (a nevertheless stressful situation to be in, as depicted in [The Big Short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q)).

An asset on the market is associated to a dynamical system, whose price varies in function of the available information. The price of an asset on a financial market is determined by a wide range of information, and in the [efficient market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), a simple change in the information will be immediately priced in.

> *The dynamics of financial systems are comparable to those of physical systems*

In the same way that phase transitions occur between solids, liquids, and gases, we can discern a normal regime on the market from a chaotic one.

Observations show that financial crashes are preceded by a period of increased [oscillation in asset prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9901035). This phenomenon translates into an abnormal change in the geometric structure of the time series.

In this post we use topological data analysis (TDA) to capture these geometric changes in the time series in order to produce a reliable detector for stock market crashes. The code is implemented mainly by [`Giotto-TDA`](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda), an open-source library for topological data analysis.

### There is little consensus about the exact definition of a financial crash

Intuitively, stock market crashes are rapid drop in asset prices. The price drop is caused by massive selling of assets, which is an attempt to close positions before prices decrease even further.

The awareness of a large speculative bubble (like in the case of the sub-primes), or a catastrophic event, will cause markets to crash. In the last two decades we have seen two major crashes: the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2008 global financial crisis.

## The results

We analyze daily prices of the S&P 500 index from 1980 to the present day. The S&P is an index that is commonly used to benchmark the state of the financial market as it measures the stock performance of the 500 large-cap US companies.

This highlights one of the key motivations behind TDA, namely that topology and geometry can provide a powerful method to abstract subtle structure in complex data.
